    "[The National Centers for Environment Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov) maintains one of the most significant archives on Earth, managing more than 30 petabytes of data and information that spans the entire spectrum of Earth’s environmental systems and cycles with comprehensive oceanic, atmospheric, and geophysical data.\n",

    "The [Storm Events Database](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00773) is an integrated database of severe weather events across the United States from 1950 to this year, with information about a storm event's location, azimuth, distance, impact, and severity, including the cost of damages to property and crops, loss of life, injuries, property damage, disruption to commerce, etc.\n",
